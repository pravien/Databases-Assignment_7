## Exercise 1

Mention which violation there are to:

First normal form is furfilled, because we can use the "Customernumber" as the primary key.

The second normal form is not being violated, because the table is in 1. normal form. Furthermore the table does not consist of any partial dependencies.

Third normal form is being vilolated, because we have a transitive dependencies. This is due to that City depends on zip.

## Exercise 2
1. Write a safe update statement that change the repPhone column from oldNumber (say 12345678) to newNumber (say 87654321).
   
2. Write an update of repEmail which do not update properly (do not update it everywhere it should)

## Exercise 3

Customername could be a good alternative to the primarykey.
I think that the violations will stay the same.
